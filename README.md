## BizOps User Journey Dashboard
This dashboard pack provides a quick overview of your user journey with a focus on conversion count, abandon count and APDEX for each user journey step. Mark each step of your user journey as a key user action or conversion goal. Each step header is a drill down link to a dashboard that compares sessions that continued vs sessions that exited for each user journey step. Drill down from the last journey step will take you to a Conversion Analysis dashboard.
